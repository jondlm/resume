## Summary

I'm a full stack web developer living and working in Portland, Oregon. I'm all
about high tech and the open web. Between my working hours, I spend a lot of
time learning new technologies; I'm always searching for "the most effective."
It's more a mentality than a destination. My technical background is diverse,

design to Node. I prefer open source when possible; it's beautiful when done
well.
